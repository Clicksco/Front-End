This document contains guidelines for web applications/sites built by the Clicksco, with regards to the Front End Engineering department.

This document's primary motivation is to contain a set of standards which will allow the organisation to grow, whilst still maintaining code-bases which look as though one person has contributed to it.

The standards below have been written in a MoSCoW-esque format, to allow the implementation to be strict, but not forceful to remove the coding style which so many of the team currently have. For more information on MoSCoW, please review this [resource](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_Method)

To allow for greater flexibility in writing our standards, we have choosen to extend the MoSCoW vocabulary with the following keywords;

- MUST NOT
- REQUIRED
- RECOMMENDED
- MAY
- OPTIONAL

For the reasoning behind this approach, please view the following [resource](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)
