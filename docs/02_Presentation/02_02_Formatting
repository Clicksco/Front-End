#### You <b>MUST</b> seperate selectors out on to multiple lines if a declaration block is shared

This allows for better readability, as well as allows for more useful diffs.

*Good Example:*

	.box,
	.box-one {
	    display: inline-block;
	}

*Bad Example:*

	.box, .box-one {
	    display: inline-block;
	}

<br />

#### You <b>SHOULD</b> cluster all properties within your declarations based on relationship e.g. spacing, typography

Grouping properties in this way allows for better readability for maintainers of the codebases, and it is also important to have a consistent approach across all your Presentation files.

The advantages of using this convention over Alphabetic ordering are that it is easier on the eye, and it makes more sense from an architectural standpoint.

*Good Example:*

	.box {
		border: 1px solid red;
		color: yellow;
		font-size: 1.8rem;
		line-height: 1.4em;
		display: inline;
		position: relative;
	}

*Bad Example:*

	.box {
		position: relative;
		border: 1px solid red;
		font-size: 1.8rem;
		color: yellow;
		display: inline;
		line-height: 1.4em;
	}
