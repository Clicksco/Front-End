#### If you would like to communicate a certain piece of code which you feel needs a refactor or is not finished, back to fellow maintainers, you <b>MUST</b> add a comment prefixed with either "@Todo" or "@fixme".

If you have a spike within your project, using this approach will allow maintainers to quickly scan a file and understand what parts could do with a new approach or requires additional work.

Using this approach, you COULD also contain a description of why you feel a certain method requires a refactor and also recommend new approaches.

*@Todo Example*

	/*
	 * @Todo
	 *
	 * A description of what is left to do on this specific piece of code
	 *
	 * Recommended solution if you have one
	 */

*@Fixme Example*

	/*
	 * @Fixme
	 *
	 * A description of why you think it should be refactored e.g. bad performance
	 *
	 * Recommended solution if you have one
	 */

<br />

#### You <b>SHOULD</b> comment any functionality using the format defined by JSDoc

This allows for a consistent approach across all code bases within the organisation, as well as being a convention which we could later use to generate documentation, once our scripts start to get large enough within applications.
