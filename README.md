# Clicksco Front End Engineering Guidelines

This document contains guidelines for web applications/sites built by Clicksco, with regards to the Front End Engineering department.

This document's primary motivation is to contain a set of standards which will allow the organisation to grow, whilst still maintaining code-bases which look as though one person has contributed to it.

The standards below have been written in a MoSCoW-esque format, to allow the implementation to be strict but not forceful, so that we do not interfere with the coding style which so many of the team currently have. For more information on MoSCoW, please review this [resource](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_Method)

To allow for greater flexibility in writing our standards, we have choosen to extend the MoSCoW vocabulary with the following keywords;

- MUST NOT
- SHOULD NOT
- REQUIRED
- RECOMMENDED
- OPTIONAL

For the reasoning behind this approach, please view the following [resource](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)

### How we write our standards

Please find an example of how we structure our standards, as well as a breakdown regarding certain sections of the standard.

##### <b>Example Standard</b>

#### You <b>SHOULD</b> use tabs over spacing.

Tab's should be set to 4 spaces. Please download our [editorconfig file]() if you're suited code editor supports this.

##### <b>Standard Breakdown</b>

1. You <b>SHOULD</b> use tabs over spacing - This is the standard itself.
2. <b>SHOULD</b> - This is the MoSCoW-esque keyword. This can be replaced with any of the keywords referenced in the introductory section of this documentation.
3. Tab's should be set to 4 spaces. Please download our [editorconfig file]() if you're suited code editor supports this. - This is a description of why this is a standard and also how it helps the team.
4. [why tabs are clearly superior](http://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/) - This is a resource to back up the standard or give the standard more detail. Each standard can contain as many resources as necessary to provide clarity, but it is not a necessity to provide any resources if you feel the standard has been presented in a clear enough manner.
