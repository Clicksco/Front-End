## General
- When putting in training requests, make sure we put a full business case forward which highlights benefits to both you as an individual and the organisation. Make sure to contain the method in which you are to share information with the rest of the team (Thap Thursday for example) and also try to focus on something generic which is not focused on a singular motive.

## Boilerplate
