## Wednesday 16th July - Weekly Minutes

### Front End Standards 

- Move solely to Github Pages and move away from hosting internally. James Mills mentioned having an internal setup for docs.clicksco.com and then we could set up a deployment hook. Needs more discussion. **Review next week** **UPDATE 23rd July - docs.clicksco.com seems like the desired approach. Currently reviewing MD to static site generators**
- Look into a new documentation engine. **Assigned to Ben Cooper**

### Front End Induction Document 

- Give access to everyone on the front end team **Assigned to Ben Cooper** **UPDATE 23rd July - Give all + Graham M access**

### Viaduct 

- Get admin access, need to speak to Jon Park **Assigned to Ben Cooper** **UPDATE 23rd July - Done**

### Front End Team Process

- Our Ethos - Performance, Automation, Testing, Architecture. This is the mentality we will take moving forward and new projects will reflect these principles.

- Areas we need to cover
	- Front End Testing Strategy - Potentially looking to create a Front End Company Dashboard which displays analytical data from internal projects to help us iterate this.
	- Technologies - Making decisions on what technologies to use in the Front End team, and documenting these decisions.
	- Technology Guides - How we use the technologies and help with setup etc for new starters.
	- Boilerplate/s - Could use a yeoman generator. Let's start with a static site boilerplate, then create variations for certain types of projects, e.g. Angular or Laravel.
